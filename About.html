  <h1>The Rescape database</h1>
    <p>
      Our Rescape research team has created this database to showcase the science behind the use of Virtual Reality (VR) in healthcare and medicine.
      The database consists of VR-relevent research articles that have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. You can search the database by research area
      to get a better understanding of what the science says and can even download a document containing links to the research that is of interest for you.
